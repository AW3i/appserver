<h1><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> What is appserver.io?</h1>

appserver.io is a next generation PHP infrastructure. It is not a webserver like Apache or nginx, nor a Timer Service or Message Queue. It is all of them and much more in one extremely powerful bundle. And it is completely written in PHP enabling PHP developers to adapt appserver.io to their specific needs with no additional coding language - just PHP!
<br /> <br />
<h2>Or in other words: appserver.io is the PHP infrastructure for the future!</h2>
