            <p>
                Since 1997 Tim works for TechDivision GmbH, including a break of 3,5 years. Since his first contact
                with PHP he was fascinated by the thought of realizing Enterprise Applications with PHP. Thus he
                developed a development-framework for PHP „struts4php“ in 2003, which was the first
                development-framework for PHP, which he published as an open-source software - long time before ZEND,
                Symfony and co. appeared. With appserver.io and the idea of a real application server written in PHP
                he wants to challenge himself again….

            <p>
                The curiosity in new technologies and the internet as perfect platform for progress provoke
                Bernhard to study informatics focused on software development and web technologies.
                Via some national and international business projects, his interest in PHP has been aroused.
