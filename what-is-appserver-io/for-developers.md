## appserver.io for developers
<hr>

We want to provide you with the world´s leading PHP infrastructure - powerful, flexible, secure and easy to use!
And we want to build it completely in PHP and as an open source project! You think we´re crazy?
No, we´re not - we´ve only high targets and from a technical perspective there are no boundaries anymore....

Some of you might think: What the hell are they doing? Why building an application server like JBoss from Java
within PHP? Well, we believe that some aspects from Java are really smart and can also be adapted into the
PHP World giving us more possibilities, security and performance! And in our point of view PHP is in the meantime
far more than "just" a scripting language....

Download it - test it and tell us your thoughts, wishes, improvements etc. - or help us by contributing to our
project! We´re looking forward to any support from your side!
