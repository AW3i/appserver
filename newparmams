- baseCtxDn the fixed dn of the context to start the user search from

    Consider that this is not the Distinguished Name of where the actual roles are;
    rather this is the DN of where the objects containg the user roles are

 * __roleAttributeIsDN__ : A flag indicating whether the user's role attribute
 contains the fully distinguished name of a role object, or the users's role
 attribute contains the role name. If false, the role name is taken from the
 value of the user's role attribute. If true, the role attribute represents the
 distinguished name of a role object.  The role name is taken from the value of
 the roleNameAttributeId` attribute of the corresponding object.  In certain
 directory schemas (e.g., Microsoft Active Directory), role (group)attributes in
 the user object are stored as DNs to role objects instead of as simple names, in
 which case, this property should be set to true. The default value of this
 property is false.

 * __roleNameAttributeID__ : The name of the attribute of the role object which
 corresponds to the name of the role.  If the __roleAttributeIsDN__ property is
 set to true, this property is used to find the role object's name attribute. If
 the __roleAttributeIsDN__ property is set to false, this property is ignored.

 * __roleRecursion__ : How deep the role search will go below a given matching
 context. Disable with 0, which is the default.
