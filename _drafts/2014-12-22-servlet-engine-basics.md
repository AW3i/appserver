As announced in our last blog post, we want to give you an overview of the services and functions an 
application server will provide. Let's start with the Servlet-Engine, because we think that this will
be a good start for all developers who never get in contact with an application server before.

Reading this post, you'll get the feeling, that a Servlet-Engine is something like a framework. This is
not completely wrong. A Servlet-Engine is not a framework, but it is a part in a framework. So you have 
to see it as the controller part of a MVC framework. This is the reason why you'll read stuff about routing,
request methods and other like that. As the framworks out there are actually not implemented for running in
an  application server like appserver.io, they provide stuff like a HTTP foundation library by themselves. 
We hope, that someday all of the frameworks recognize the advantages an application server provide and will
be ported to run on top of appserver.io by using the infrastructure with all functionality it provides,
instead of implementing it again and again in each of them. For sure this will be a long way, but i think i'll 
be worth it.

### Problems without Servlet-Engine
***

Some of you, who are familiar with a Java Servlet-Engine will wonder: a Servlet-Engine in PHP? Does 
that make sense because of all the great frameworks out there. We think yes, because one of the big
issues with the frameworks is, that they'll get huge during the last years and bootstrapping became
a big meaning meanwhile. As PHP is used as a scripting language, the problem of the bootstrapping is,
that is has be done at every request and therefore it leads to a massive loss of performance. One 
solution can be caching, but that entails many other problems that you may have faced in your projects.

### How can a Servlet-Engine help
***

One solution can be using a Servlet-Engine, like we integrated in our application server. Imagine a
`Servlet` as a class that implements the `Servlet` interface, part of our PSR's, that provides some
kind of MVC pattern controller functionality by implementing some methods that will be invoked when
a request came in, nothing more, nothing less. So to implement your first `Servlet`, you have to think
about two things. First, which requests should our `Servlet` dispatch, the second is what functionality
it should provide.

As in many other frameworks do, our Servlet-Engine use a URL path to map a request to a controller, in
our case this will be a `Servlet`. You can write as many servlets as you want, but you dont't need to
write any configuration therefor. Let's have a look at how you can map an URL path to a `Servlet`

```php
namespace AppserverIo\Examples\Servlets;

use AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServlet;
use AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServletRequest;
use AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServletResponse;

/**
 * This is the famous 'Hello World' as servlet implementation.
 *
 * @Route(name="helloWorld", urlPattern={"/helloWorld.do", "/helloWorld.do*"})
 */
class HelloWorldServlet extends HttpServlet
{

  /**
   * Handles a HTTP GET request.
   *
   * @param \AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServletRequest  $servletRequest  
   *   The request instance
   * @param \AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServletResponse $servletResponse 
   *   The response instance
   *
   * @return void
   * @see \AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServlet::doGet()
   */
  public function doGet(
    HttpServletRequest $servletRequest,
    HttpServletResponse $servletResponse)
  {
    $servletResponse->appendBodyStream('Hello World!');
  }
}
```

To map a `Servlet` to a URL, you can simply use the `@Route` annotation. With the `name` attribute you have
specify a name that has to be unique in your application scope, the attribute `urlPattern` allows you to
specify a list of URL patterns you want to map the `Servlet` to. In our example, we want to map the 
`HelloWorldServlet` to the URL's like `http://127.0.0.1:9080/examples/helloWorld.do`, whatever parameters
are appended.

Last but not least, we've to implement the `doGet()` method, that'll be invoked, when a `GET` request,
has been sent, and therefore is the main entry point to handle the request by implementing the functionality
we want to provide. For our first example, we only want to add the `Hello World!` that should be rendered.

That is pretty simple, we think! So, given you've downloaded and installed the latest version of the application
server, create a folder `examples/WEB-INF/classes/AppserverIo/Example/Servlets` under the `webapps` folder of 
your installation. In the folder, create a new file named `HelloWorldServlet.php`, copy the code from above and
save it. After [restarting](https://github.com/appserver-io/appserver/wiki/02.-Basic-Usage#start-and-stop-scripts)
the application server, open the URL `http://127.0.0.1:9080/examples/helloWorld.do` in your favorite browser.
You should see the text `Hello World`. Congratulations, you have written your first `Servlet`!

> Simplicity is one of our main targets, because we want you to write your applications with a minimum of 
> configuration, actually NULL. So to start write an application that perfectly works in the application

### Bootstrapping a Servlet

As described before, bootstrapping a framework with every request is a very expensive procedure if have be done
again and again. Using an application server with a Servlet-Engine can be a great help here. Beside the fact,
that parsing configuration like the `@Route` annotation, will be done only once when the application server
starts, You additionally have the possiblity to do all that expensive stuff in an `Ã¬nit()` method that'll be
invoked by the application server when the `Servlet` is instanciated and initialized at startup. Let's extend
our previous example

```php
namespace AppserverIo\Examples\Servlets;

use AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\ServletConfig;
use AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServlet;
use AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServletRequest;
use AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServletResponse;

/**
 * This is the famous 'Hello World' as servlet implementation.
 *
 * @Route(name="helloWorld", urlPattern={"/helloWorld.do", "/helloWorld.do*"})
 */
class HelloWorldServlet extends HttpServlet
{

  /**
   * Resources parsed from a INI file.
   *
   * @var array
   */
  protected $resources;

  /**
   * Initializes the servlet with the passed configuration.
   *
   * @param \AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\ServletConfig $config 
   *   The configuration to initialize the servlet with
   *
   * @return void
   */
  public function init(ServletConfig $config)
  {

    // call parent method
    parent::init($config);
    
    // parse the application resources from an INI file
    $this->resources = parse_ini_file($config->getWebappPath() . '/WEB-INF/resources.ini');
  }
  
  /**
   * Handles a HTTP GET request.
   *
   * @param \AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServletRequest  $servletRequest  
   *   The request instance
   * @param \AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServletResponse $servletResponse 
   *   The response instance
   *
   * @return void
   * @see \AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServlet::doGet()
   */
  public function doGet(
    HttpServletRequest $servletRequest,
    HttpServletResponse $servletResponse)
  {
    $servletResponse->appendBodyStream($this->resources['hello-world.en_US.key']);
  }
}
```

We've extended the example by reading the translated `Hello World!` from a resource file, when the application
server starts. When we handle the request later, we only need to resolve the translation from the array with
the resources by its key.

> You can get major performance improvements, letting the application server do CPU expensive functionality
> during startup. Keep in mind, that you get a copy of the `Servlet` when the `doGet()` method is invoked.
> Therefor it doesn't make sense to write data to members there, because it'll be not available in the next
> request!

### Passing data from configuration
***

In some cases, it'll be necessary, that you need to pass data to the `init()` method, e. g. configuration
values. You can also do this with the `@Route` annotation. So imagine, we want to make the path to the file
with the resources configurable.

```php
namespace AppserverIo\Examples\Servlets;

use AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\ServletConfig;
use AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServlet;
use AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServletRequest;
use AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServletResponse;

/**
 * This is the famous 'Hello World' as servlet implementation.
 *
 * @Route(name="helloWorld",
 *        urlPattern={"/helloWorld.do", "/helloWorld.do*"}
 *        initParams={"resourceFile", "WEB-INF/resources.ini"})
 */
class HelloWorldServlet extends HttpServlet
{

  /**
   * Resources parsed from a INI file.
   *
   * @var array
   */
  protected $resources;

  /**
   * Initializes the servlet with the passed configuration.
   *
   * @param \AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\ServletConfig $config 
   *   The configuration to initialize the servlet with
   *
   * @return void
   */
  public function init(ServletConfig $config)
  {

    // call parent method
    parent::init($config);
    
    // parse the application resources from an INI file
    $this->resources = parse_ini_file(
       $config->getWebappPath() . '/' . $config->getInitParam('resourceFile')
    );
  }
  
  /**
   * Handles a HTTP GET request.
   *
   * @param \AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServletRequest  $servletRequest  
   *   The request instance
   * @param \AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServletResponse $servletResponse 
   *   The response instance
   *
   * @return void
   * @see \AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServlet::doGet()
   */
  public function doGet(
    HttpServletRequest $servletRequest,
    HttpServletResponse $servletResponse)
  {
    $servletResponse->appendBodyStream($this->resources['hello-world.en_US.key']);
  }
}
```

With the `Ã¬nitParams` attribute of the `@Route` annotation you can specify a list of parameters that'll
available later by the `$config` instance passed to the `Ã¬nit()` method. You can specify a random number
of key/value pair whereas the first value will be the key you later can load the value with. In our example
we register a the path to our resources file `WEB-INF/resources.ini` under the key `resourceFile` in our
servlet configuration. In the `Ã¬nit()` method we can then load the path from the servlet configuration.

> You maybe think, that it doesn't make to much sense specifying such values in an annotation. That can be
> true, but keep in mind, that you can overwrite these values later in a XML configuration. So you can see
> the values specified in the annotation as some kind of default value. We'll see an example of how we can

### Starting a Session
***

Starting a session is one of the things you'll need in nearly every application. Start a new session is
quite simple. So let's see how we can integrate session handling in our application.

```php
namespace AppserverIo\Examples\Servlets;

use AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\ServletConfig;
use AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServlet;
use AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServletRequest;
use AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServletResponse;

/**
 * This is the famous 'Hello World' as servlet implementation.
 *
 * @Route(name="helloWorld",
 *        urlPattern={"/helloWorld.do", "/helloWorld.do*"}
 *        initParams={"resourceFile", "WEB-INF/resources.ini"})
 */
class HelloWorldServlet extends HttpServlet
{

  /**
   * Resources parsed from a INI file.
   *
   * @var array
   */
  protected $resources;

  /**
   * Initializes the servlet with the passed configuration.
   *
   * @param \AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\ServletConfig $config 
   *   The configuration to initialize the servlet with
   *
   * @return void
   */
  public function init(ServletConfig $config)
  {

    // call parent method
    parent::init($config);
    
    // parse the application resources from an INI file
    $this->resources = parse_ini_file(
      $config->getWebappPath() . '/' . $config->getInitParameter('resourceFile')
    );
  }
  
  /**
   * Handles a HTTP GET request.
   *
   * @param \AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServletRequest  $servletRequest  
   *   The request instance
   * @param \AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServletResponse $servletResponse 
   *   The response instance
   *
   * @return void
   * @see \AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServlet::doGet()
   */
  public function doGet(
    HttpServletRequest $servletRequest,
    HttpServletResponse $servletResponse)
  { 
  
    // try to load the username from the session
    if ($session = $servletRequest->getSession()) {
      $username = $session->getData('username');
    } else { // username not available
      $username = 'Unknown';
    }
    
    // prepare the hello world string, this should look like 'Hello World %s!'
    $helloWorld = sprintf($this->resources['hello-world.en_US.key'], $username);
    
    // append the prepared hello world to the response
    $servletResponse->appendBodyStream($helloWorld);
  }
  
  /**
   * Handles a HTTP POST request.
   *
   * This is a very simple example that shows how to start a new session, adding
   * the username passed with the POST data to the session.
   *
   * @param \AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServletRequest  $servletRequest  
   *   The request instance
   * @param \AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServletResponse $servletResponse 
   *   The response instance
   *
   * @return void
   * @see \AppserverIo\Psr\Servlet\Http\HttpServlet::doGet()
   */
  public function doPost(
    HttpServletRequest $servletRequest,
    HttpServletResponse $servletResponse)
  {
  
    // create a new session, if not available
    $session = $servletRequest->getSession(true);
    
    // start the session and add the cookie to the response
    $session->start();
    
    // store the username found in the POST data
    $session->putData('username', $servletRequest->getParameter('username'));
  }
}
```

This is a very simple example of how you can start a session and add some data to it. Session handling is a
complicated thing and we tried to break it down to be as simple as we can imagine. By default you don't have
to configure anything, but you still have to option to configure everything in a XML configuration file that
has to be stored in you applications `WEB-INF` folder as `web.xml`.

### Optional XML Configuration
***

As described before, we thought, that it have to be very simple, to write a `Servlet`. Therefore we provide
annotations that gives you the power to configure the basics. For sure, for many things we deliver a good
default configuration, but you need the power to overwrite that.

You can overwrite the default configuration values in a simple XML file called `web.xml` that you've to 
store in your applications `WEB-INF` folder. In that file you can configure Servlets, overwrite values you've
specified in annotations, change the default session settings and give or deny users access to resources with
HTTP basic or digest authentication.
