After more than 2 years, we're proud to present the first stable 1.0.0 version appserver.io infrastructure solution!

### Bugfixes

* Fixed [#514](https://github.com/appserver-io/appserver/issues/514) - @Singleton session bean needs @Startup annotation
* Fixed [#513](https://github.com/appserver-io/appserver/issues/513) - Manually creating a timer results in a segfault
* Fixed bug for invalid call to format() method if `calculateNextTimeout()` returns `NULL`
* Fixed bug in `SplClassLoaderFactory::visit()` method by add missing `$configuration` parameter

### Features

* Removed old dependencies
* Updated to stable requirements

### Notes

* IMPORTANT: Since version 1.0.0-rc3 we've refactored system critical functionality. Please be aware, that anything you've developed on versions before 1.0.0 needs to be refactored before it'll run on this release!
* For detailed installation instructions look at our [documentation](http://appserver.io/get-started/documentation.html)
* It is strongly recommended, that you'll remove installed versions before upgrading to 1.0.0
* Linux packages are split in runtime and distribution packages. So please install both of them. Runtime packages provide `appserver-runtime` which the `appserver-dist` package depends on
* For bleeding edge development builds, check our [nightly builds](http://builds.appserver.io) page
