* Introduced [#469](https://github.com/appserver-io/appserver/issues/469) Provide setup script for developer mode
* Updated dependencies

### Notes

* IMPORTANT: Since version 0.6.0 we've refactored nearly everything. Please be aware, that anything you've developed on versions before 1.0.0-rc3 needs to be refactored before it'll run on this release!
* For detailed installation instructions look at our [documentation](http://appserver.io/get-started/documentation.html)
* It is strongly recommended, that you'll remove installed versions before upgrading to 1.0.0-rc3
* Linux packages are split in runtime and distribution packages. So please install both of them. Runtime packages provide `appserver-runtime` which the `appserver-dist` package depends on
* For latest updates and bugfixes (this is a RC after all) have a look at our [development builds](http://builds.appserver.io)
