# appserver.io 1.0 the most powerful PHP infrastructure is now available for free

> With the stable release of [appserver.io](http://appserver.io) PHP enters a new era. After nearly two years of development,
TechDivision GmbH, finally released appserver.io 1.0.0, the first real PHP Application Server, fully written in PHP.
appserver.io supports multi-threading out-of-the-box and is completely open source! That release is also a proof of
concept that stateful application development with PHP, a scripting language, is possible at all and opens countless
new opportunities in the PHP ecosystem including real enterprise applications. Another cool thing: appserver.io can
be used with existing applications like Drupal, Magento or Wordpress, and they benefit from the performance and
additional opportunities of appserver.io.

appserver.io is the first player in the previously, only by non PHP language tools, covered market segment of
infrastructure solutions. The LAMP stack, together with countless 3rd party tools, has, by now, been the backbone of
millions of low and midrange web applications, e-commerce solutions and websites. With the growing demand of the
market, making PHP ready for real enterprise solutions, the LAMP stack reaches its limits. Especially areas like
maintainability and scalability are, compared to common solutions, bottlenecks the PHP ecosystem is responsible to
find working solutions for.

appserver.io exactly focus that topics and enters the stage as a fully featured infrastructure solution that replaces
the "A" and pulls the 3rd party tools out of the LAMP stack. Based on a fast and rock solid HTTP/1.1 compliant web
server written in PHP as the first layer, appserver.io provides a Persistence- Container and a Servlet-Engine as
second. Finally the last layer is built by a Message-Queue and a Timer- Service which makes heavy use of the
Persistence-Container functionality. These completely stateful services are bundled with functionalities like AOP,
Dependency-Injection, Design-by-Contract and Annotations, that massively speeds up application development,
maintainability and reusability.

As all functionality has been completely written in PHP, developers doesn't need to know other programming languages,
what will remove the dangerous language and knowledge break.

Appserver.io is the most powerful PHP infrastructure that comes with the following features together in one bundle:

* A fully HTTP/1.1 compliant webserver which can process requests over HTTP as well as HTTPS
* Easy to use rewrite engine which is completely compatible to apache rewrites
* Servlet Engine that provides a web container enabling developers to load applications and objects in memory
* Message Queue that provides services enabling developers to process messages asynchronously
* Timer Service enabling the execution of methods at a determined point of time
* Persistence Container enabling developers to hold objects, so-called beans, in memory.

[TechDivision GmbH](http://www.techdivision.com), the company behind appserver.io, decided to publish and operate the
solution as real open source software. The company is convinced, that this will be the best way to make appserver.io
itself part of the PHP community and let developers, that are interested to help pushing the language up to a new
level, be part of the project.

The first release is also a proof of concept that stateful application development with PHP, a scripting language,
is possible at all and opens countless new opportunities in the PHP ecosystem. Beside a huge roadmap with features
for the next release 1.1.0 aka "Iron Knight", TechDivision GmbH will work on a Enterprise Edition that'll cover
enterprise level requirements like load balancing, clustering and failover functionality.
