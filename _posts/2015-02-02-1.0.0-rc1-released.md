First Release Candidate for appserver.io 1.0.0 aka "Iron Horse"

This RC provides several bugfixes, improvements and PHPUnit tests. 

### Bugfixes

* Added missing dependency to appserver-io/lang
* Fixed MQ memory leak because of missing job thread when handling messages
* Fixed invalid namespace in QueueManager::createSenderForQueue() method
* Remove unnecessary interfaces SenderInterface + ReceiverInterface
* Fixed error when prepared directories to be created on startup
* Bugfix within service tests
* Minor bugfixes

### Features

* Refactoring, move interfaces of Persistence-Container + Message-Queue to separate packages
* Removed risk factor of non-injected \Stackable within class loader
* Applied new file name and coding conventions
* Updated dependencies

### Notes
* IMPORTANT: Since version 0.6.0 we've refactored nearly everything. Please be aware, that anything you've developed on versions before 1.0.0-rc1 needs to be refactored before it'll run on this release!
* For detailed installation instructions look at our [documentation](<{{ "/get-started/documentation.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}>)
* It is strongly recommended, that you'll remove installed versions before upgrading to 1.0.0-rc1
* Linux packages are split in runtime and distribution packages. So please install both of them. Runtime packages provide `appserver-runtime` which the `appserver-dist` package depends on
* For latest updates and bugfixes (this is a beta after all) have a look at our [nightly builds](http://builds.appserver.io)
