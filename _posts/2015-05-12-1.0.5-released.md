This release provides bugfixes and updates.

> We **STRONGLY** recommend, that you have a look at our [upgrade guide](https://github.com/appserver-io/appserver/blob/1.0/UPGRADE-1.0.5.md), before upgrading your installation to 1.0.5!

### Notes

* Please be aware, that our Mac OS X installer actually is **NOT** aware of changes you've made to your configuration files. So it is necessary to **BACKUP** all configuration files you've customized, to not loose your changes.
* For detailed installation instructions look at our [documentation](http://appserver.io/get-started/documentation.html)
* Linux packages are split in runtime and distribution packages. So please install both of them. Runtime packages provide `appserver-runtime` which the `appserver-dist` package depends on
* For bleeding edge development builds, check our [developer builds](http://builds.appserver.io) page
