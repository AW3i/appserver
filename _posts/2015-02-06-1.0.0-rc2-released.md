Second Release Candidate for appserver.io 1.0.0 aka "Iron Horse"

This RC provides several bugfixes and optimizations. 

### Bugfixes

* Fixed missing documentRoot param to persistence-container configuration in `appserver.xml`
* Fixed invalid registration of local/remote business interfaces for session beans

### Features

* Closed #473 - Create deployment PSR
* Log exceptions thrown in ServletEngine::process method
* Move OS specific templates and resources to dist packages
* Allow argument `--install-dir` and `--override` for composer post-install-cmd
* Remove `var/www/core_functions.php` script and include from server.php
* Add method `AbstractServletEngine::logCriticalException()` to simplify exception logging

### Notes

* IMPORTANT: Since version 0.6.0 we've refactored nearly everything. Please be aware, that anything you've developed on versions before 1.0.0-rc2 needs to be refactored before it'll run on this release!
* For detailed installation instructions look at our [WIKI](https://github.com/appserver-io/appserver/wiki)
* It is strongly recommended, that you'll remove installed versions before upgrading to 1.0.0-rc2
* Linux packages are split in runtime and distribution packages. So please install both of them. Runtime packages provide `appserver-runtime` which the `appserver-dist` package depends on
* For latest updates and bugfixes (this is a RC after all) have a look at our [development builds](http://builds.appserver.io)
