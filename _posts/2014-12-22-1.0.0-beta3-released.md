Today we've released 1.0.0-beta3. This release primarily contains a bugfix that solves a FastCGI connection problem
when using latest HHVM versions

### Bugfixes
***

* Fixing problems with FastCGI connection to latest HHVM versions
* Analytics module configuration within virtual hosts was ignored

### Notes
***

* IMPORTANT: Since version 0.6.0 we've refactored nearly everything. Please be aware, that anything you've developed on versions before 1.0.0-beta needs to be refactored before it'll run on this release!
* For detailed installation instructions look at our [documentation](<{{ "/documentation/installation.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}>)
* It is strongly recommended, that you'll remove installed versions before upgrading to 1.0.0-beta3
* Linux packages are split in runtime and distribution packages. So please install both of them. Runtime packages provide `appserver-runtime` which the `appserver-dist` package depends on
* For latest updates and bugfixes (this is a beta after all) have a look at our [nightly builds](http://builds.appserver.io)
