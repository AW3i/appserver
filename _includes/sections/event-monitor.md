## Event Monitor

The Event Monitor enables to watch and control all services of the infrastructural environment right up to applications running on that platform itself. The service allows to use notifications on any defined incidents. The notification handling is generic in order to use all possible channels like mail, SMS even other monitoring platforms can be triggered. Events can be used to specify custom incidents and can also be used in an application running on appserver.io.
