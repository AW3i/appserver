## <i class="fa fa-refresh"></i> Rewrite-Engine

The Rewrite-Engine is implemented as a webserver module and provides a module for rewriting URLs and redirecting requests by using classical regular expressions. Rules can be varied, nested and chained to even fulfill complex requirements. In addition, the rewrite engine also serves as a basis for complex rewrite maps which can be loaded from external datasources as e.g. databases.
