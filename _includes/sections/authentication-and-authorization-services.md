## Authentication and Authorization Services

Authentication and Authorization Services not only secures access to the dashboard, but also provides the possibility to create business rules and workflows within the infrastructure. A workflow manager, integrated with the Dashboard, can also be used in an application context to build up processes and workflows. A central identity management with LDAP or Active Directory can also be connected and is shipped with the possibility of creating ACL and user roles.
