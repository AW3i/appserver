# 1ST APPSERVER.IO HACKATHON
***
appserver.io is a next-generation PHP infrastructure consisting of a lightning fast webserver completely written in PHP
including additional frequently needed services like a rewrite engine, a Message Queue, a Timer Service and more in one
powerful bundle. You can use all of the services or only specifically selected services in your existing application with
no additional tweaks. This is just what you need since we have eliminated the need for additional tools or additional services,
appserver.io and PHP and you´re done!

With more than 15.000 Downloads within the last couple of month, some really cool projects using appserver.io in live environments
and pretty cool feedback from all over the world we´re very excited and motivated to build the best open source infrastructure for
PHP in the world.

But now we need you!!! Join us at the 1st appserver.io hackathon, meet cool people and help us to build really cool and helpful stuff
based on or within appserver.io.
