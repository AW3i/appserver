## Implementing an application based on appserver.io

* Port an app you like and explore new functionality with it
* Design a framework for your next eCommerce project
* Empower your clients with a stateful webservice as a backend
* etc.

## Extend the appserver.io infrastructure

* Try building a full page cache module to speed up your sites
* Automate server management and see what's possible
* Connect your apps with powerful infrastructure components e.g. for authentication
* Help us tackle problems on bringing appserver.io to the next level of PHP enterprise infrastructure
* etc.

## Got another crazy idea? Just join us for our first Hackathon and discuss with the appserver.io core developers!
