## <i class="fa fa-database"></i> Persistence-Container

The Persistence Container enables developers to hold objects, so-called beans, in memory whereby it is possible to define whether a bean will be a singleton, bound to a HTTP session or has no state at all. In addition to that, the Persistence Container allows you to make transparent use of a beans local or remote business interface. This allows application developers to implement independent, loose coupled, and reusable components that can be distributed across a network without the need change any source code.
