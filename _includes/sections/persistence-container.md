## Persistence-Container

The Persistence-Container enables developers to hold objects, so-called components, in memory whereby it is possible to define whether a component will be a singleton, bound to a HTTP session or has no state at all. In addition to that, the Persistence-Container allows you to make transparent use of a components local or remote business interface. This enables application developers to implement independent, loosely coupled, maintainable and reusable components that can be distributed across a network without the need change any source code.
