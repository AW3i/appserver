## Persistence-Container

The Persistence-Container enables developers to hold objects, so-called components, in memory whereby it is possible to define whether a component will be a singleton, bound to an HTTP session or has no state at all. In addition to that, the Persistence-Container allows you to make transparent use of components local or remote business interface. That enables application developers to implement independent, loosely coupled, maintainable and reusable components that can be distributed across a network without the need change any source code.
