## <i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i> Timer-Service

The Timer Service enables the execution of methods at a determined point of time whereby the configuration, as execution in the range of seconds is also possible, allows a significant higher differentiation then services like CRON. In contrast to most available solutions, developers don't have to configure scripts that'll be executed, instead they configure methods of message driven, stateless or singleton session beans. Beside scheduled execution it is possible to create timers programmatically what allows you to invoke methods once or scheduled at a dedicated point of time in future.
