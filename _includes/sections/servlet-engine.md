## <i class="fa fa-bookmark"></i> Servlet-Engine

The Servlet Engine provides a web container that enables developers to load applications and objects, so-called servlets, on application server startup and hold them persistently in memory. Using servlets allows you to optimize your applications bootstrapping to take place at application servers startup time. As a result, the time to process requests will be significantly lower compared to applications running on the common LAMP stack.
