## Webserver

Provides a fully HTTP/1.1 compliant, component based webserver, which can process requests over HTTP as well as HTTPS. Basic functionality can be extended by the usage of completely independent, configurable modules interacting via module hooks with the request/response chain. With the bundled FastCGI module, knwon backends like PHP-FPM and HHVM can simply be configured to handle incoming requests.
