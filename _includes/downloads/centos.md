**Runs and tested on CentOS 6 (64-bit)!**

Installation and basic usage is the same as on Fedora but we provide different packages for runtime
and distribution. CentOS requires additional repositories like
<a href="http://rpms.famillecollet.com/" target="_blank">remi</a> or
<a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL" target="_blank">EPEL</a> to satisfy
additional dependencies.
