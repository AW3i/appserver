Works for Windows 7 (32-bit) and higher!

As we deliver the Windows appserver as a .jar file you can download, a installed Java Runtime
Environment (or JDK that is) is a vital requirement for using it. If the JRE/JDK is not installed
you have to do so first. You might get it from [Oracle's download page](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7-downloads-1880261.html).
If this requirement is met you can start the installation by simply double-clicking
the .jar archive.
