As an experiment we offer Raspbian and brought the appserver to an ARM environment.
What should we say, it worked! :D With

{% highlight bash %}
os.distribution = raspbian
{% endhighlight %}

you might give it a try to build it yourself (plan at least 5 hours) as we currently do
not offer prepared install packages.
